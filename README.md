While the data displayed in this analysis showcases the ridership demographic and trends in utilization in NYC, there will need to be extensive research and analyisis done to determine the profitability of such a service in Des Moines. It is clear that in NYC, people are opting to bike to work and this commute typically takes a short amount of time (around 5 minutes). There needs to be a supplemental analyiss that observes the commuting behoviors of the labor force in Des Moines. We will need to analyize how far the working population lives from their location of work to determine viability of bikesharing as a commuting option in Des Moines. We could also benefit from taking a deeper dive into how age plays a factor in the ridership and then compare that to the population of Des Moines. If the majority of the population in Des Moines is, for example, older than in NYC, we might see lower utilization given the inherently athletic nature of the service.
